File and Directory Permissions Denotation Owner = u, Group = g, Others = o
What command removes the write permission for the group from a file?. The answer is chmod g-w file_name
Find files/directories under /var/log/ directory that the group can write to, but others cannot read or write to it. Save the list of the files/directories (with complete parent path) in /home/bob/data.txt file. You can use the redirection to save your command's output in a file i.e [your-command] > /home/bob/data.txt. To make this easier to understand, the logic of the command can be broken down like this: Permissions for the group have to be at least w. If there's also an extra r or x in there, it will still match. Permissions for others have not to be r or w. That means, if any of these two permissions, r or w match for others, the result has to be excluded. The answer is: sudo find /var/log/ -perm -g=w ! -perm /o=rw | tee -a /home/bob/data.txt
Find our secret file under /home/bob. You can either look for a file that is exactly 213 kilobytes or a file that has permission 402 in octal. Save the name (including the parent directory path) of this file in /home/bob/secfile.txt file. You can use the redirection to save your command's output in a file i.e [your-command] > /home/bob/secfile.txt. The answer is find /home/bob -type f -size 213k -perm /402 | tee -a  /home/bob/secfile.txt
In our lessons we briefly mentioned the setuid, setgid and sticky bit special permissions. Consider that setuid is short for set user id. setgid is short for set group id. Add the permissions for setuid, setgid and sticky bit on /home/bob/datadir directory. The answer is chmod u+s,g+s,o+t /home/bob/datadir
Find dogs.txt file under /usr/share directory.Save the location of the file in /home/bob/dogs file. The answer is  sudo find /usr/share -name dogs.txt | tee -a /home/bob/dogs
Find cats.txt file under bob's home directory and copy it into /opt directory. The answer is sudo find ~ -name cats.txt; sudo cp /home/bob/.etc/h/e/r/cats.txt /opt/cats.txt
Find all directories named pets in /var/directory and save the output (along with directory path) in /home/bob/pets.txt file. You should be able to save the output in a file using redirection i.e <your-command> > /home/bob/pets.txt. The answer is sudo find /var -type d -name pets | tee -a /home/bob/pets.txt
Find all the files whose permissions are 0777 in /var directory  How many such files did you find?. The answer is: sudo find /var -type f -perm 0777 | wc -l 
Find all the files whose permissions are 0640 in /usr/ directory and save the output (along with parent path) in /home/bob/.opt/permissions.txt file. You should be able to save the output in a file using redirection i.e <your-command> > /home/bob/.opt/permissions.txt. The answer is: sudo find /usr -type f -perm 0640 | tee -a /home/bob/.opt/permissions.txt 
Find all the files which have been modified in the last 2 hours in /usr directory. How many such files did you find?. The answer is: sudo find /usr -type f -mmin -120 | wc -l 
Find all the files which have been modified in the last 30 minutes in the /var directory. How many such files did you find?. The answer is: sudo find /var -type file -mmin -30 | wc -l
Find all the files with size 20MB in /var directory. How many such files did you find?. The answer is: sudo find /var -type f -size 20M | wc -l
Find all files between 5mb and 10mb in the /usr directory and save the output (along with parent path) in /home/bob/size.txt file. You should be able to save the output in a file using redirection i.e <your-command> > home/bob/size.txt. The answer is: sudo find /usr -type f -size +5M -size -10M | tee -a /home/bob/size.txt
Create a directory named LFCS under bob's home directory and update its user owner permissions to only x (execute), and group and others should not have any permissions. It should give us a permission denied error while listing the contents of the directory. The answer is: mkdir LFCS; chmod 0100 LFCS;
Update the permissions for some_directory to rwxr-xr-x. The answer is: chmod 0755 some_directory
